# Sentiment Analysis with BERT and Transformers
**Sentiment analysis** (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.

**BERT** stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of unlabelled text including the entire Wikipedia(thatâ€™s 2,500 million words!) and Book Corpus (800 million words). The most impressive aspect of BERT is that we can fine-tune it by adding just a couple of additional output layers to create state-of-the-art models for a variety of NLP tasks.
